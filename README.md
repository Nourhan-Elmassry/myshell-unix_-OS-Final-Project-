# 🟣myshell-unix_-OS-Final-Project-

This project is a simple UNIX command-line shell developed in C as part of an
Operating Systems course.

The main goal of this project is to understand how a shell works internally
and how it interacts with the operating system.

## 🟣Features
- Built-in commands (cd, dir, echo, environ, help, pause, quit)
- Execution of external programs using fork and exec
- Input and output redirection (<, >, >>)
- Background execution using &
- Batch mode support (execute commands from a file)
- Environment variable handling (shell, parent)

## 🟣Demo
A presentation and a demonstration video are included to explain the design
and show how the shell works on a Linux system.

## 🟣Technologies
- C Programming Language
- Linux / UNIX
- Process Management
- System Calls

## 🟣Notes
This project was developed for educational purposes as part of an Operating
Systems course.
