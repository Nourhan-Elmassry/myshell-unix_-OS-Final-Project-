# 🟣myshell-unix_-OS-Final-Project-

This project is a simple UNIX command-line shell developed in C as part of an

- Background execution using &
- Batch mode support (execute commands from a file)
- Environment variable handling (shell, parent)

## 2️⃣Demo
A presentation and a demonstration video are included to explain the design
and show how the shell works on a Linux system.

## 3️⃣Technologies
- C Programming Language
- Linux / UNIX
- Process Management
- System Calls

## 4️⃣Notes
This project was developed for educational purposes as part of an Operating
Systems course.
